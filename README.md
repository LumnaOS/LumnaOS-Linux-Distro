# LumnaOS
The OFFICIAL GitHub repository for the LumnaOS Linux Distribution.


**LumnaOS** is an easy-to-use Linux distribution built from LinuxFromScratch, designed for speed, efficiency, and simplicity. It features a minimal footprint, ensuring smooth performance on both older and newer hardware, and offers users the freedom to customize their computing environment to their needs.

Currently, LumnaOS does not include a GUI (Graphical User Interface), but plans are underway to integrate one using BeyondLinuxFromScratch. The website is designed as if the GUI is already present, in anticipation of future updates.

## Key Features
